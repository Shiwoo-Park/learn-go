# Learning Go with nomadcoder

[Lecture Link](https://nomadcoders.co/go-for-beginners/lectures/1499)

## What I learned about Go
- To compile the project we need main.go if not, we don't nee main.go
- Go specifically looking for main() in main package for entry point
- When you want to export function (=use publically) use uppercase for first letter to function name
- Go built-in package is very huge and has a lot of useful functions. [take look!](https://golang.org/pkg/)

## Commands

```bash
go run main.go
```
